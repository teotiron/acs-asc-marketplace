# ACS - ASC Assignment - Marketplace
Teodor Tiron 334CA

This assignment implements a marketplace using the Multi Producer Multi
Consumer problem. The Producer objects create and publish products to a buffer
list in the marketplace, while the Consumer objects try to add the products to
a cart (which is another list managed the marketplace). When a consumer adds
an item to their cart, they remove the item from the buffer. If the consumer
removes the object from the cart, it will be added back to the buffer even if
the buffer is full.

# Synchronisation issues
Most functions that use critical regions use a single lock object. The only
exceptions are the register_producer() and get_cart() methods, which have their
own locks due to the fact that they only ever add new buffers and never modify
existing ones.
